# Employee Shift Management System - System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the system architecture for the Employee Shift Management System. The architecture is designed to support the functional and non-functional requirements specified in the requirements analysis, with a particular focus on scalability, maintainability, and the integration of constraint-based scheduling logic.

## Architectural Style

The Employee Shift Management System will follow a modern, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns. We will implement a full-stack application using the following architectural patterns:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: Separating the user interface (client) from the business logic and data storage (server).
2. **Microservices-Inspired Architecture**: While not a full microservices implementation, the backend will be organized into logical services with well-defined responsibilities.
3. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: For organizing both frontend and backend code.
4. **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction.
5. **Service Layer Pattern**: For encapsulating business logic.

## High-Level Architecture

The system will consist of the following major components:

### Frontend Application

The frontend will be built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.js. This approach provides a responsive and interactive user experience while minimizing server round-trips. The frontend will communicate with the backend exclusively through RESTful APIs.

Key frontend components include:

1. **Authentication Module**: Handles user login, logout, and session management.
2. **Employee Management Module**: Interfaces for CRUD operations on employee records.
3. **Position Management Module**: Interfaces for defining and managing positions and their requirements.
4. **Shift Calendar Module**: Interactive calendars for viewing and managing schedules.
5. **Reporting Module**: Dashboards and reports for monitoring compliance and performance.
6. **Admin Module**: System configuration and user management.
7. **Self-Service Portal**: Employee-specific views and functionality.

The frontend will use Redux for state management, ensuring consistent application state and facilitating complex interactions between components. React Router will handle client-side routing, providing a seamless single-page application experience.

### Backend Services

The backend will be implemented using Node.js with Express, chosen for its performance, scalability, and extensive ecosystem. The backend will be organized into the following logical services:

1. **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
2. **Employee Service**: Manages employee data and operations.
3. **Position Service**: Manages position definitions and requirements.
4. **Scheduling Service**: Implements the constraint-based scheduling engine.
5. **Reporting Service**: Generates reports and alerts.
6. **Integration Service**: Handles integration with external systems (e.g., calendar systems).

Each service will expose a RESTful API for communication with the frontend and other services. The services will share a common database but will access it through separate repositories to maintain separation of concerns.

### Scheduling Engine

The scheduling engine deserves special attention as it is the core component of the system. It will be implemented as a specialized service within the backend, using Google OR-Tools for constraint satisfaction and optimization.

The scheduling engine will:

1. Define constraints based on legal requirements and organizational policies.
2. Generate optimal schedules that satisfy all constraints.
3. Provide explanations for scheduling decisions.
4. Support manual overrides with validation.
5. Adapt to changing requirements and preferences.

The engine will run as both a scheduled process (generating schedules for future periods) and on-demand (when manual adjustments require recalculation).

### Database Layer

PostgreSQL will serve as the primary database system, chosen for its robust support for complex queries, transactions, and data integrity constraints. The database will be accessed through a repository layer that abstracts the details of data storage and retrieval.

### External Integrations

The system will support integration with external systems, particularly calendar systems like Google Calendar. These integrations will be implemented through dedicated adapters that translate between the internal data model and external APIs.

## Component Interactions

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials through the frontend.
2. Authentication service validates credentials and issues a JWT token.
3. Frontend stores the token and includes it in subsequent API requests.
4. Backend services validate the token for each request and enforce role-based access control.

### Schedule Generation Flow

1. Administrator configures positions and coverage requirements.
2. Scheduling service retrieves employee data, position requirements, and constraints.
3. Scheduling engine generates optimal schedules using constraint programming.
4. Generated schedules are stored in the database.
5. Notifications are sent to affected employees.
6. Schedules are available for viewing through the calendar interface.

### Schedule Adjustment Flow

1. Administrator or scheduler requests a schedule change.
2. Frontend sends the change request to the scheduling service.
3. Scheduling service validates the change against constraints.
4. If valid, the change is applied and stored in the database.
5. If invalid, the service returns an explanation of the constraint violation.
6. Affected employees are notified of the change.

### Reporting Flow

1. User requests a specific report through the frontend.
2. Reporting service retrieves relevant data from the database.
3. Service processes the data according to report requirements.
4. Generated report is returned to the frontend for display.
5. User can export the report to PDF or Excel if needed.

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally to accommodate growing organizations and increasing complexity:

1. **Stateless Backend**: The backend services are designed to be stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling by adding more instances.
2. **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL can be scaled through read replicas and connection pooling.
3. **Caching**: Redis will be used for caching frequently accessed data and reducing database load.
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running tasks like schedule generation will be handled asynchronously using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Redis).
5. **Microservices Evolution**: The logical service separation allows for future evolution into a true microservices architecture if needed.

## Security Architecture

Security is a critical concern for a system handling employee data and work schedules:

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token storage.
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control enforced at both API and UI levels.
3. **Data Protection**: Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
4. **API Security**: Rate limiting, CORS configuration, and input validation.
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of system actions for accountability.
6. **Vulnerability Prevention**: Regular security audits and dependency updates.

## Deployment Architecture

The system will be deployed using a containerized approach:

1. **Development**: Docker Compose for local development environments.
2. **Testing**: Containerized test environments with automated testing.
3. **Production**: Kubernetes for orchestration in production environments.
4. **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL service or containerized with persistent volumes.
5. **Networking**: Internal service communication via Kubernetes services, external access via ingress controllers.

## Monitoring and Observability

To ensure system health and performance:

1. **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus for collecting and storing metrics.
2. **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards for monitoring system performance.
3. **Logging**: Centralized logging with the ELK Stack.
4. **Alerting**: Automated alerts for system issues and anomalies.
5. **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flows across services.

## Conclusion

The proposed architecture for the Employee Shift Management System provides a solid foundation for implementing the required functionality while ensuring scalability, maintainability, and security. The separation of concerns and modular design allow for incremental development and future enhancements, while the choice of technologies balances modern best practices with practical considerations for development and deployment.

The architecture particularly emphasizes the integration of constraint-based scheduling logic, which is central to the system's value proposition. By encapsulating this logic in a dedicated service with clear interfaces, we ensure that the complex scheduling requirements can be met without compromising the overall system design.
