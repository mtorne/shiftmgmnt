# Employee Shift Management System - Requirements Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the requirements for the Employee Shift Management System. The system is designed to automatically calculate and assign shifts based on predefined constraints and legal regulations, with a strong focus on compliance and optimization. It will manage employees, positions, and shift schedules efficiently.

## Functional Requirements

### Employee Management

The system requires robust employee management capabilities to track and maintain employee information and work hours. Each employee in the system will have a profile containing personal information, work preferences, and work hour allocations. The system will maintain a total yearly work hours quota for each employee, typically set at 1,760 hours per year, though this should be configurable. The system will continuously track remaining hours, used hours, and any violations of work hour regulations.

The employee management module will support complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing administrators to add new employees, view employee details, update employee information, and remove employees from the system when necessary. Each employee record will contain essential information such as name, contact details, position, skills, and any special considerations for scheduling.

### Position & Schedule Management

The position and schedule management module will allow the definition of various positions within the organization, each with specific coverage requirements. For example, some positions may require 24-hour coverage, 7 days a week (such as IT Support), while others might need coverage for 16 hours a day, 5 days a week (such as Customer Service).

For each position, the system will define:
- Minimum staffing requirements per shift to ensure adequate coverage
- Weekly and daily schedule patterns to establish regular rotation cycles
- Skill requirements to ensure qualified personnel are assigned

The system will support the creation, modification, and deletion of positions, allowing organizations to adapt to changing operational needs. It will also enable the definition of different shift types (morning, afternoon, night) with specific start and end times for each position.

### Shift Assignment Engine

The core of the system is the shift assignment engine, which will automatically generate and assign shifts while ensuring compliance with legal regulations and organizational policies. The engine will enforce several constraints:
- No employee works more than 8 hours per day to prevent fatigue and comply with labor laws
- Employees receive at least 2 consecutive free days per week to ensure adequate rest periods
- Total yearly hours do not exceed the allocated quota for each employee

The assignment engine will also take into account:
- Employee availability and preferences when possible, to improve satisfaction
- Fair distribution of night and weekend shifts among eligible employees
- Required skills and certifications for specific positions
- Historical assignment data to ensure equitable distribution over time

The engine will use advanced algorithms, potentially incorporating constraint programming or optimization libraries such as Google OR-Tools or OptaPlanner, to generate optimal schedules that satisfy all constraints while maximizing coverage and employee satisfaction.

### Shift Calendar View

The system will provide comprehensive calendar views to visualize schedules from different perspectives. Users will be able to access:
- Monthly and weekly calendar views for individual employees
- Global schedule views for each position showing all assigned employees
- Customizable filters to view schedules by employee, position, or time range

The calendar interface will use color coding to distinguish between different shift types and highlight potential issues such as understaffing or compliance violations. It will support interactive features such as drag-and-drop for manual adjustments when necessary, with automatic validation to prevent the creation of non-compliant schedules.

### Reporting & Alerts

The reporting and alerts module will provide insights into scheduling patterns and highlight potential issues. The system will generate reports on:
- Hours worked versus planned for individual employees and departments
- Compliance with legal requirements and organizational policies
- Staffing levels compared to requirements
- Historical trends in scheduling and coverage

The system will also generate alerts for:
- Legal violations such as insufficient rest periods or excessive working hours
- Understaffing situations that could impact operations
- Approaching limits on yearly work hours for individual employees
- Conflicts in scheduling or employee availability

Reports will be available in various formats, including on-screen dashboards, downloadable PDFs, and exportable data files for further analysis.

## Technical Requirements

### Backend

The backend will be implemented using a modern, scalable framework. Based on the requirements, we will use Node.js with Express or Python with FastAPI, as these technologies offer excellent performance, scalability, and support for complex business logic. The backend will handle:
- API endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Authentication and authorization
- Business logic for shift assignment and validation
- Data persistence and retrieval
- Integration with external systems when necessary

### Frontend

The frontend will be built using React.js, a popular and powerful library for building user interfaces. React offers excellent performance, component reusability, and a rich ecosystem of supporting libraries. The frontend will provide:
- Intuitive user interfaces for all system functions
- Interactive calendars and scheduling views
- Responsive design for access from various devices
- Real-time updates when schedules change
- Accessible interfaces compliant with WCAG guidelines

### Database

PostgreSQL will be used as the primary database system due to its robust support for complex queries, transactions, and data integrity constraints. The database schema will be designed to efficiently store and retrieve:
- Employee information and work hour allocations
- Position definitions and coverage requirements
- Shift assignments and schedules
- Historical data for reporting and analysis
- System configuration and preferences

### Scheduling Logic

The scheduling logic will be implemented using appropriate optimization libraries. Google OR-Tools is a strong candidate due to its powerful constraint satisfaction capabilities and integration options with both Node.js and Python. The scheduling component will:
- Define constraints based on legal requirements and organizational policies
- Generate optimal schedules that satisfy all constraints
- Provide explanations for scheduling decisions
- Support manual overrides with validation
- Adapt to changing requirements and preferences

## Bonus Features

### Export Functionality

The system will support exporting schedules and reports to various formats, including PDF and Excel. This will enable sharing information with stakeholders who may not have direct access to the system and facilitate integration with other business processes.

### Role-based Access Control

The system will implement role-based access control with at least three distinct roles:
- Administrators with full system access
- Schedulers who can create and modify schedules
- Employees who can view their own schedules and submit requests

Each role will have appropriate permissions and interface customizations to support their specific needs while maintaining system security.

### Employee Self-service Portal

An employee self-service portal will allow staff to:
- View their current and future schedules
- Submit requests for time off or shift changes
- Update their availability and preferences
- View their work hour allocations and history

This portal will improve employee engagement and reduce administrative overhead for schedule management.

### Calendar Integration

The system will support integration with external calendar systems such as Google Calendar, allowing employees to synchronize their work schedules with their personal calendars. This integration will use standard protocols such as iCal to ensure broad compatibility.

## Non-functional Requirements

### Compliance

The system will prioritize legal compliance in all scheduling operations, ensuring that generated schedules adhere to:
- Maximum daily and weekly working hours
- Minimum rest periods between shifts
- Requirements for consecutive days off
- Any industry-specific regulations

### Usability

The user interface will be designed for ease of use, with intuitive navigation, clear visual cues, and contextual help. The system will minimize the learning curve for new users while providing advanced features for experienced users.

### Performance

The system will maintain responsive performance even with large datasets, ensuring that:
- Schedule generation completes within acceptable timeframes
- User interface remains responsive during complex operations
- Reports generate quickly even with extensive historical data

### Scalability

The architecture will support scaling to accommodate growing organizations, allowing for:
- Increasing numbers of employees and positions
- More complex scheduling constraints
- Higher transaction volumes
- Additional features and integrations

### Security

The system will implement robust security measures to protect sensitive employee data and prevent unauthorized access, including:
